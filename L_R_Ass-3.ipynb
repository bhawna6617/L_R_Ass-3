These metrics are often in a trade-off relationship: improving precision may lower recall and vice versa, depending on the classification threshold used by the model. Therefore, it's essential to consider both precision and recall together to get a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance, especially in scenarios where the cost of false positives and false negatives differs.\n",

    "# Logistic regression, which is commonly used for binary classification, can be extended to handle multiclass classification through various techniques. One common approach is the \"one-vs-rest\" (OvR) or \"one-vs-all\" strategy. In this approach, a separate logistic regression model is trained for each class, with the objective of distinguishing that class from all other classes. During prediction, each model outputs a probability score indicating the likelihood of an instance belonging to its corresponding class. The class with the highest probability score is then predicted as the final output.\n",

    "# Another approach is the \"multinomial logistic regression\" or \"softmax regression,\" where a single model is trained to predict the probabilities of each class directly. The model uses the softmax function to convert raw scores into class probabilities, ensuring that the probabilities sum up to one across all classes. This approach is particularly useful when the classes are mutually exclusive.\n",
